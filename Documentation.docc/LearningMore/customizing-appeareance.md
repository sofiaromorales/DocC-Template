# Customizing the Appearance of Your Documentation Pages

Customize the look and feel of your documentation webpages.

## Summary

By default, rendered documentation webpages produced by DocC come with a default visual styling. If you wish, you may make adjustments to this styling by adding an optional theme-settings.json file to the root of your documentation catalog with some configuration. This file is used to customize various things like colors and fonts. You can even make changes to the way that specific elements appear, like buttons, code listings, and asides. Additionally, some metadata for the website can be configured in this file, and it can also be used to opt in or opt out of certain default rendering behavior.

If youâ€™re curious about the full capabilities of the theme-settings.json file, you can check out the latest Open API specification for it [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc/blob/main/Sources/SwiftDocC/SwiftDocC.docc/Resources/ThemeSettings.spec.json), which documents all valid settings that could be present.
